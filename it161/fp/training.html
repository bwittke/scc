    <h3>Weekly Workouts<h3> 

    <p>Cloud City Track Club offers <b>two</b> group workouts a week: a weekday <b>speed</b> workout and a weekend <b>long run</b> workout.
        To account for busy schedules, we offer <b>two</b> different practice times for weekday workouts.
    <p>If you are interested in trying out a workout, please fill out this <a href="join.html" target="_blank">form</a> and we will be in touch
    with you shortly. Existing club members can find weekly workout details posted in the <b>Team Slack</b>.</p>
